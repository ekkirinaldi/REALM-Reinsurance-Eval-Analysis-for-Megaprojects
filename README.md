# REALM: Reinsurance-Eval-Analysis-for-Megaprojects

## Overview

This project is REALM (Reinsurance-Eval-Analysis-for-Megaprojects). REALM aims to develop a comprehensive risk assessment and reinsurance evaluation framework specifically tailored for megaprojects in the construction industry.

## Description

REALM is designed to address the unique challenges associated with risk management and insurance for large-scale construction projects. The framework integrates quantitative risk analysis techniques with reinsurance evaluation models to provide a robust tool for stakeholders involved in megaproject planning and execution.

Key features of REALM include:

- Systematic review of quantitative risk analysis methodologies for construction megaprojects
- Integration of insurance payout records to reflect actual quantitative losses in risk assessment models
- Advanced decision-making support for governance and management of megaprojects
- Customized risk evaluation techniques for plant construction and long-term infrastructure projects
- Incorporation of both hindsight analysis and predictive modeling for comprehensive project assessment
